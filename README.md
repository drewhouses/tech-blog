# Tech Blog Application

## Description

This application allows you to sign up and create blog posts to share with other users.

The Tech Blog App serves as a showcase for my skills in:

- DOM Manipulation
- Implementation of the MVC paradigm using ExpressJS Handlebars
- Supporting a web app with a MySQL database with help from SequelizeJS
- Implementation of a user session management system with ExpressJS Session

This project helped me develop a deeper understanding in reconciling front-end web code with a backend web server. As well as familiarizing myself with MVC management
